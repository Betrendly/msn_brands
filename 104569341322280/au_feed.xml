Family and friends thought she was laying low, trying to rebuild her life after leaving an ex who would not stop contacting her. But when she missed her daughter’s birthday, panic set in. Investigators quickly learned Ashley had reported being followed and harassed in the weeks leading up to her disappearance. Her abandoned car was later found, her belongings still inside, but Ashley has never been located. With no arrests and no confirmed sightings, the question remains: did Ashley walk away, or did someone finally make good on the threats she feared?</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/104569341322280/788914344167914.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">749426018203804au</guid><title>Colorado Dentist Charged After Allegedly Poisoning Wife’s Protein Shakes</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/749426018203804/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 19:15:00 GMT</pubDate><description>Investigators say Dr. James Craig, a respected Colorado dentist and father of six, secretly ordered potassium cyanide and slipped it into his wife Angela’s protein shakes—only months after allegedly trying to poison her before. As Angela’s mysterious symptoms worsened, police say Craig continued showing up to work as if nothing was wrong, all while exchanging romantic emails with a lover. But when Angela died and the toxicology report came back, the trail of online purchases, chilling searches, and a past pattern of suspected poisoning attempts pointed straight to James. Was this a calculated murder for a new life—or a husband desperate to hide a long history of deception?</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/104569341322280/749426018203804.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1303015324927202au</guid><title>Was He Poisoned at the Bottom of the World?

The boy had been placed with Hannah and Larry Overton, a local couple in the process of adopting him, after entering the foster care system earlier in life. Medical examinations confirmed the cause of death as salt intoxication, prompting an immediate investigation by authorities.Hannah Overton, a mother of four who was pregnant at the time, was arrested and charged with capital murder in 2007. Prosecutors argued that she had intentionally caused the boy's condition, leading to her conviction and a sentence of life without parole. The case drew significant attention due to the unusual circumstances surrounding the death and questions about the evidence presented at trial.Years of appeals followed, with new medical opinions suggesting the possibility of an accidental occurrence linked to the child's behavioral tendencies. In 2014, Texas' highest criminal court overturned the conviction on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. Charges were dismissed in 2015, and in 2017, the Nueces County District Attorney officially declared Hannah Overton innocent, closing the case and allowing her eligibility for state compensation for wrongful incarceration.The Overton family has since focused on healing and supporting others through community efforts. The tragic loss of Andrew Burd remains a somber chapter, highlighting complexities in child welfare and legal proceedings. No further developments have been reported in recent years.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/104569341322280/1190044556431403.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1377962037133236au</guid><title>He Disappeared After Using His Homemade Time Machine</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1377962037133236/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 23:01:00 GMT</pubDate><description>He Disappeared After Using His Homemade Time Machine</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/104569341322280/1377962037133236.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">3394215750730877au</guid><title>She Vanished at Just 5 Years Old and Was Never Seen Again</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/3394215750730877/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>In 2004, 5-year-old LeeAnna Warner disappeared from her home in Chisholm, Minnesota, and more than two decades later, her case remains unsolved.
