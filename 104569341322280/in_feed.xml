Police found her abandoned vehicle and blood evidence at her home during the ensuing search, but her body has never been recovered and she is presumed dead.

Her estranged husband Fotis Dulos and his girlfriend Michelle Troconis were charged in connection with her disappearance; Fotis died by suicide in 2020 while facing charges.

Law enforcement tracked evidence to Hemy Neuman, who had worked with Sneiderman’s wife and was later arrested and charged in the killing.

Neuman was convicted by a jury of malice murder and firearm charges in a 2016 retrial and sentenced to life in prison without parole, though his initial conviction had been overturned on appeal due to trial errors.

Prosecutors alleged Neuman acted with a motive tied to his relationship with Sneiderman’s wife, Andrea Sneiderman, though she has denied involvement and was later convicted on unrelated perjury and false statement charges.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/104569341322280/1952518485333011.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">25366822609679898in</guid><title>James &amp; Jennifer Faith: When a Marriage Turned Deadly</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/25366822609679898/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 16:09:00 GMT</pubDate><description>From the outside, James and Jennifer Faith appeared to have a normal marriage, but behind closed doors, cracks were forming fast.

She was last seen sleeping on the family’s balcony in the early morning hours, but by sunrise she was gone, with no signs of a fall and no body ever recovered. Despite massive searches by the U.S. Navy, the FBI, and local authorities, Amy was never found, and over the years multiple reported sightings have suggested she may have been abducted and trafficked rather than lost at sea. Nearly three decades later, her disappearance remains one of the most chilling and unexplained cruise ship mysteries in modern history.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/104569341322280/1645887076571409.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">903455318873734in</guid><title>Ballerina Ashley Benefield Kills Husband in “Self Defense”</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/903455318873734/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>Ashley Benefield, a former ballerina and founder of a dance academy, shot and killed her husband Doug Benefield inside their Florida home and told police she acted in self defense, but investigators say the shooting came after months of escalating conflict, financial disputes, and a bitter custody battle over their young daughter; prosecutors argue the killing was intentional and part of a pattern of manipulation and control, while the defense claims Ashley feared for her life after repeated threats and abuse, making this case a high stakes legal fight over whether the shooting was justified or a calculated act of violence.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/104569341322280/903455318873734.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">916383634388038in</guid><title>Danyé Jones’ Mother Says Investigators Were Laughing After Responding to the Scene</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/916383634388038/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>When 24-year-old Danyé Jones was discovered hanging from a tree in St. Louis County, local police quickly labeled it a suicide.
