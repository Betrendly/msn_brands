Surveillance footage showed her estranged husband, Fotis Dulos, and his girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, discarding trash bags in Hartford. Inside were items stained with Jennifer's blood, ponchos, zip ties, gloves, and clothing—linking them to her disappearance. Fotis died by suicide in 2020; Troconis was convicted in 2024 for conspiracy to commit murder and evidence tampering. Jennifer was declared legally dead in 2023, but her body remains missing.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/104569341322280/1505715224213091.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">650542431216479sg</guid><title>Chief Grant Hardin Betrayed the Oath to Protect and Serve</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/650542431216479/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 20:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>Grant Hardin, a former police chief, briefly escaped from prison in 2025 before being recaptured, raising concerns about prison security and oversight.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/104569341322280/650542431216479.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1863127734604056sg</guid><title>Travis Walton’s Unbelievable UFO Story</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1863127734604056/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 16:45:00 GMT</pubDate><description>In 1975, logger Travis Walton claimed he was taken by a UFO in Arizona.
