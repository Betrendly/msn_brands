Claims of self-defense under Florida’s Stand-Your-Ground law failed to convince a jury, who found Lorincz guilty of manslaughter and sentenced her to 25 years. The crime is now the focus of the Netflix documentary The Perfect Neighbor, which uses body-cam footage to examine the breakdown of community, race and self-defense.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/1947755219115282.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1625682778598459us</guid><title>He Ended The Life Of His Pregnant Girlfriend</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1625682778598459/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 23:01:00 GMT</pubDate><description>He Ended The Life Of His Pregnant Girlfriend</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/thumb_1625682778598459.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1526166095472792us</guid><title>BIZARRE Relationship Between Mother &amp; Son</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1526166095472792/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>Between 1978 and 1981, Spokane, Washington was terrorized by a man authorities later identified as Frederick “Kevin” Coe. For years, dozens of women were attacked in the same upscale neighborhood, leaving the city on edge until a series of identifications finally led investigators to Coe. The case only grew stranger as details emerged about his background, his powerful family, and his mother’s extreme attempts to defend him—even plotting retaliation against officials. Multiple trials, overturned convictions, and a landmark legal battle eventually resulted in Coe being confined as a sexually violent predator, where he remains today.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/1526166095472792.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">4250513958602761us</guid><title>The Terrifying Story Of Peter Keller</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/4250513958602761/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><description>In 2012, investigators in Washington State searched for Peter Keller after discovering that his wife and daughter had been found deceased inside the family home.

Before her arrest in 1991, she spent years without stable housing, support, or access to meaningful help. Prosecutors, investigators, and people around her later acknowledged that her circumstances and trauma shaped nearly every part of her life. Her case raises ongoing questions about how vulnerable individuals move through systems that are not equipped to protect them, and how those gaps can lead to tragic outcomes for everyone involved.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/742946614724408.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1292002872609378us</guid><title>Unraveling the Evil Plot of Jennifer Faith</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1292002872609378/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><description>Jennifer Lynne Faith admitted to orchestrating the 2020 killing of her husband, Jamie Faith, by persuading her former high-school boyfriend to carry out the shooting and concealing a $600 k life-insurance claim and a GoFundMe fraud.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/1292002872609378.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">2928679820853904us</guid><title>"Do You Want Mom to Live?"
