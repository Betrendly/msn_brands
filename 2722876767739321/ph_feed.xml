Davis told officers he was responsible for the attack and cooperated during his arrest.

He later pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and received a life sentence under Texas law. The case drew attention due to his age at the time and statements he made after the incident.

Davis remains in prison and is eligible for parole decades into his sentence. Law enforcement treated the matter as an isolated domestic homicide with no further charges against others.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/1553770329260138.jpg" /><media:content url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/1553770329260138.mp4" type="video/mp4" medium="video" duration="412"><media:title>His Mother Was the First Person on His Kill List</media:title><media:description>In March 2014 in Corpus Christi, Texas, 18-year-old Kevin Davis admitted fatally stabbing his mother Kimberly Hill inside their home and then turning himself in to police.
