Her disappearance prompted a multi-agency search involving campus police and county authorities. Investigators later located her body off-campus, and a medical examiner confirmed she had been killed.

Law enforcement arrested 22-year-old Levi Collen in connection with Bryant’s death. Prosecutors stated that evidence collected from surveillance footage, digital records, and witness information linked Collen to the area where Bryant was last seen and to the crime itself. Collen was not a student at the university but had been seen in the vicinity around the time Bryant disappeared.

In court Collen was charged with first degree murder and other related offenses. Prosecutors argued the evidence showed intentional causation of Bryant’s death. The defense did not dispute certain factual elements but raised questions about aspects of the investigation. A jury later found Collen guilty on the murder charge.

Collen was sentenced under Missouri law to a term reflecting the severity of the crime. Authorities stated the conviction brought legal resolution to the homicide, and no additional suspects have been publicly identified in connection with Bryant’s death.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/1432221098332728.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">4352437204991685sg</guid><title>The Cruelest Mother Ever: Mitchelle Blair</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/4352437204991685/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 19:15:00 GMT</pubDate><description>In 2015, police in Detroit discovered the bodies of two children concealed inside a freezer at an apartment complex. The children were identified as siblings who had previously lived in the residence. The discovery followed an investigation into neglect and unsafe living conditions involving the family.  Mitchelle Blair, the children’s mother, was arrested and later charged in connection with their deaths. Prosecutors stated that the children had died years earlier and that their deaths were concealed. The case involved extensive review of housing records, prior child welfare contacts, and medical findings.  In 2019, Blair pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including first degree murder and child abuse. During court proceedings, she admitted responsibility for the deaths. The court accepted the plea, concluding the case without a trial.  Blair was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Authorities stated the case underscored failures in oversight and prompted reviews of child welfare response procedures in the city.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/4352437204991685.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">3819997308302217sg</guid><title>She Was Found At The School Bathroom - Ta'ir Rada</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/3819997308302217/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate><description>In December 2006, thirteen year old Ta ir Rada was found dead inside a bathroom at her school in Katzrin, Israel. The discovery prompted a nationwide investigation and intense public attention. Authorities confirmed she had been killed while still on school grounds.  In 2010, Roman Zadorov, an immigrant from Ukraine who worked as a contractor at the school, was convicted of murder based largely on a confession and circumstantial evidence. He was sentenced to life in prison. From the outset, the case generated controversy, with questions raised about the investigation and the reliability of the confession.  Over the years, legal appeals and new forensic reviews led to growing doubt about the conviction. In 2021, Israel’s Supreme Court ordered a retrial, citing issues with the original proceedings and evidence. In 2023, Zadorov was acquitted after the court ruled the prosecution had not proven guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  The case remains one of the most debated criminal investigations in Israel’s history. Authorities have stated that Ta ir Rada’s killing is still unresolved, and no alternative suspect has been formally charged.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/3819997308302217.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">2327280164401336sg</guid><title>Thought DNA Would Be Used To Clone Him?</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/2327280164401336/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><description>Lisa Ziegert was a 24 year old clothing store manager who was abducted after closing a shop in Agawam, Massachusetts, in December 1992. Her body was found days later in a wooded area near her workplace. The case remained unsolved for more than two decades despite extensive investigation.  In 2017, Gary Schara was arrested and charged with murder after advances in DNA testing linked him to the crime. Prosecutors stated that forensic evidence connected him to Ziegert and the scene. Schara pleaded not guilty and the case proceeded to trial.  In 2019, a jury convicted Schara of first degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Authorities stated the conviction brought long awaited resolution to a case that had deeply affected the local community.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/2327280164401336.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1623272832417396sg</guid><title>Betrayed by His Family</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1623272832417396/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><description>In June 2021, Maggie Murdaugh and her son Paul were found shot to death at the family’s rural property in Colleton County, South Carolina. Their husband and father, Alex Murdaugh, reported discovering the bodies and initially denied involvement. The case drew national attention due to the family’s long standing legal influence in the region.  In March 2023, Alex Murdaugh was convicted of two counts of murder following a jury trial. Prosecutors presented evidence placing him at the crime scene shortly before the killings, including video recordings and digital data. The defense argued the evidence was circumstantial, but jurors returned guilty verdicts after deliberation.  Murdaugh was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole. The court found the crimes were motivated by mounting financial pressure and exposure of extensive financial misconduct. Separate civil lawsuits related to those financial matters remain active.  Since the conviction, Murdaugh has filed appeals seeking a new trial, citing alleged issues with jury conduct and trial procedure. As of now, the convictions stand, and he remains incarcerated while the appeals process continues.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/1623272832417396.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">857796100481245sg</guid><title>She Was Only 13 Years Old! - Tabitha Tuders</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/857796100481245/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 02:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>On April 29, 2003, 13 year old Tabitha Tuders left her home in Nashville, Tennessee to walk to her school bus stop. She never made it to school and was never seen again.  Tabitha was described as a quiet, kind hearted girl who loved music and art. That morning, multiple witnesses reported seeing her walking alone, but after that, she seemed to vanish without a trace. No confirmed sightings were ever reported after she reached the area near her middle school.  The case immediately raised concerns about foul play, but investigators struggled with a lack of physical evidence. Over the years, several persons of interest were questioned, including a known offender who lived nearby, yet no charges were ever filed. Searches, tips, and renewed investigations have all failed to bring definitive answers.  More than two decades later, Tabitha Tuders remains missing. Her case continues to haunt her family and community, serving as a painful reminder of how quickly a life can disappear and how long the search for truth can last.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/857796100481245.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1110133397757148sg</guid><title>Insane Case of Billy Payne &amp; Billie Jean Hayworth</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1110133397757148/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 02:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>In March 2012, Billy Payne and Billie Jean Hayworth were found dead inside their home in Union County, Tennessee. The discovery came after a family member went to check on them and alerted authorities, launching a homicide investigation in the rural community.  Early in the case, attention turned toward members of the couple’s extended family. Investigators uncovered evidence suggesting a dispute involving money and control over property, which helped narrow the focus of the inquiry as more details emerged.  Prosecutors ultimately charged Payne’s cousin, Chris Newsom, and his girlfriend, Amber Bowman, in connection with the killings. Court records showed that the case relied heavily on forensic evidence and testimony gathered during the investigation.  In 2014, both defendants were convicted and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The case brought long awaited answers to the victims’ families and remains one of the most widely discussed criminal cases in eastern Tennessee history.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/1110133397757148.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1420776726383003sg</guid><title>Bruce McArthur's Chilling Double Life</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1420776726383003/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 02:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>Bruce McArthur was a self employed landscaper in Toronto who worked for years in affluent neighborhoods and had long standing ties to the city’s Gay Village. To many clients and acquaintances, he appeared dependable and unremarkable, blending easily into everyday life.  Between 2010 and 2017, several men connected to Toronto’s LGBTQ community were reported missing. For years, the disappearances were treated as unrelated, and families struggled with limited answers as the cases remained unresolved.  In 2018, investigators arrested McArthur and later uncovered evidence linking him to multiple deaths. In 2019, he pleaded guilty to eight counts of murder, bringing long awaited confirmation to families who had spent years searching for loved ones.  The case led to widespread review of police procedures, particularly around missing persons investigations involving marginalized communities. It remains one of the most significant criminal cases in Canadian history and continues to shape conversations about trust, visibility, and accountability.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/1420776726383003.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">903145285708167sg</guid><title>He'll NEVER Forget What He Saw</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/903145285708167/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:04:00 GMT</pubDate><description>In 2016, the death of sixteen year old Emma Stutzman inside her Amish family’s Ohio home initially appeared to be a medical emergency. She was found unresponsive, and early explanations offered to authorities did not immediately raise suspicion beyond a sudden illness.  As investigators reviewed the circumstances more closely, inconsistencies began to emerge. The county coroner later ruled Emma’s death a homicide, prompting a deeper investigation that focused on someone within her immediate family and community.  Authorities identified her older brother, Eli Stutzman, as the person responsible for her death. Before the case could proceed through the court system, officials confirmed that Eli died shortly after being named as the suspect, bringing the criminal investigation to an abrupt end.  The case drew national attention due to its setting within a traditionally private Amish community and raised difficult questions about oversight, reporting, and justice in insular societies. Emma Stutzman’s death remains a deeply painful chapter for those who knew her.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/903145285708167.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1100387898741411sg</guid><title>The Saddening Case Of 15-Months-Old Evelyn Boswell</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1100387898741411/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>Evelyn Mae Boswell was a 15 month old child from Sullivan County Tennessee whose whereabouts became a concern in early 2020 after family members reported they had not seen her for several months. Authorities later confirmed she had last been seen in December 2019, despite claims that she was staying with relatives. The delay in reporting immediately raised red flags for investigators.  As the search expanded, law enforcement identified inconsistencies in statements given by Evelyn’s mother Megan Boswell and others close to the child. Officials focused on reconstructing Evelyn’s movements and determining who had last confirmed contact with her. Public appeals and search efforts continued as scrutiny intensified.  In March 2020, investigators located Evelyn’s remains on property linked to Megan Boswell. She was later charged with multiple offenses related to false reporting and the handling of evidence, followed by additional charges as the case progressed. The case drew national attention and highlighted the consequences of delayed reporting in missing child investigations.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/1100387898741411.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">32862296606749735sg</guid><title>Real-Life "Home Alone" Case With Parents Who Abandoned Their Kids for 9 Days During Christmas</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/32862296606749735/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>In December 1992, a case out of Chicago shocked the public after two young sisters were found living alone just days before Christmas. Nine year old Nicole Schoo and her four year old sister Diana were discovered by a neighbor after coming to her door cold and frightened, saying their parents had left town.  The girls told authorities their parents, David and Sharon Schoo, had flown to Acapulco for a nine day vacation. The children were not left with a babysitter or any emergency contact. Instead, they were given frozen meals, cereal, and written instructions on when to eat and when to go to bed.  Emergency responders arrived after reports of a possible fire alarm but found no adults in the home. The girls were placed with their grandmother and later into foster care while police searched for their parents. David and Sharon Schoo were located a week later at an airport in Houston as they were returning to the United States.  Both parents were charged with multiple counts related to child abandonment and endangerment. The case drew nationwide attention and intense public backlash. Ultimately, the couple avoided trial by accepting a plea deal and were sentenced to two years of probation.  The incident led to changes in state law and remains one of the most disturbing examples of parental neglect during the holiday season.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/32862296606749735.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1487572992314813sg</guid><title>The Secrets Under His Backyard!</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1487572992314813/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>Herb Baumeister was a successful Indiana businessman and family man who lived in a quiet suburban neighborhood during the 1990s. On the surface, his life appeared stable, with a growing company and a large home known as Fox Hollow Farm.  Behind closed doors, Baumeister was allegedly leading a hidden double life. He was known to frequent Indianapolis nightlife and was rumored to seek secret encounters that he carefully concealed from his family. Over time, several men connected to these social circles were reported missing.  In 1996, investigators began searching Baumeisters property after receiving information that raised serious concerns. What they discovered in the wooded area behind his home would later become central to one of Indianas most disturbing investigations, revealing evidence that suggested multiple victims.  Before authorities could fully question him, Baumeister fled the country. Days later, he was found deceased in Canada, leaving many unanswered questions. The discoveries at his home would later confirm that the truth hidden beneath his backyard was far darker than anyone had imagined.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/1487572992314813.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">868810326039736sg</guid><title>Fred And Rose West's House Of Horrors</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/868810326039736/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 19:30:00 GMT</pubDate><description>In the mid 1990s, police in Gloucester England began investigating Fred and Rosemary West after renewed focus on long unresolved missing person cases. A search of the family home quickly changed the direction of the inquiry and revealed evidence of serious crimes spanning many years.  Investigators determined that multiple victims were connected to the West household, with offenses occurring across properties linked to the couple. The findings raised urgent questions about how the activity went undetected for so long and prompted a broader review of earlier reports and warnings.  Fred West died before standing trial, while Rosemary West was later convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. The case became a defining moment in British criminal history, influencing how authorities approach long term abuse, missing persons investigations, and safeguarding failures within communities.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/868810326039736.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1973199309910595sg</guid><title>Is This The Most Evil Person Of The 1900's?</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1973199309910595/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 16:04:00 GMT</pubDate><description>Is This The Most Evil Person Of The 1900's?</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/thumb_1973199309910595.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1243755920983723sg</guid><title>Love, Loss, and the Unseen Evil</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1243755920983723/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>Andrew Bagby was a 28 year old medical graduate found shot multiple times in a Pennsylvania park in November 2001. Investigators quickly focused on his former partner, Shirley Jane Turner, who fled to Canada shortly after his death and later announced she was pregnant with his child, Zachary Turner.  Despite facing extradition to the United States, Turner was granted bail in Newfoundland and awarded custody of Zachary. Authorities and Andrew’s parents repeatedly raised concerns about the child’s safety, but the courts allowed Turner to remain free while legal proceedings continued.  In August 2003, both Shirley Turner and 13 month old Zachary were found deceased in Conception Bay South. A public inquiry later concluded that the system failed to protect Zachary and that his death was preventable, leading to major changes in Canadian bail laws known as Zachary’s Bill.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/1243755920983723.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">827786986743212sg</guid><title>The Chilling Story Of The Atlanta Monster!</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/827786986743212/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 18:15:00 GMT</pubDate><description>From July 1979 to May 1981, authorities in Atlanta investigated the deaths of at least 29 African-American children and young adults, mostly boys. The series began with the discoveries of 14-year-old Edward Hope Smith and 13-year-old Alfred Evans in a wooded area. Most victims died from asphyxiation, with remains often found in remote spots.Notable cases included 9-year-old Yusuf Bell, 12-year-old Angel Lenair, 13-year-old Lubie Geter, and 13-year-old Curtis Walker. The incidents caused widespread concern, leading to community safety measures and a large-scale task force investigation.Wayne Williams was convicted in 1982 of two adult murders and linked to several child cases through evidence, though not charged in them. In 2019, officials began re-examining preserved evidence with modern DNA methods.As of late 2025, no new public findings from the re-testing have been announced.

Hits like Blame It on the Rain dominated charts worldwide.In November 1990, Farian revealed that Morvan and Pilatus did not sing on the recordings, with vocals provided by session singers. The duo had lip-synced performances. The Grammy was revoked, marking the first such action, and public backlash followed as lawsuits emerged from fans seeking refunds.Morvan and Pilatus attempted a comeback as Rob &amp; Fab in 1993 with an album featuring their own vocals, but it saw limited release. Pilatus faced personal challenges and passed away in 1998 from an accidental overdose at age 32, just before a planned Milli Vanilli reunion project.Surviving member Fab Morvan has pursued music and shared the story through a 2023 documentary and his 2025 memoir.

The animals belonged to Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel, attorneys who were caring for the dogs on behalf of a convicted felon connected to an underground dog breeding operation.  The dogs, Bane and Hera, were Presa Canarios linked to a network that bred and trained aggressive dogs for protection and intimidation. Evidence later revealed that the animals had a documented history of violent behavior and that repeated warnings about their danger were ignored.  Whipple was attacked when she encountered Knoller in the hallway while returning home from grocery shopping. Despite attempts to intervene, the attack lasted several minutes and resulted in fatal injuries.  The case led to a highly publicized trial. In 2002, Knoller was convicted of second degree murder, later reduced to voluntary manslaughter, while Noel was convicted of involuntary manslaughter.
