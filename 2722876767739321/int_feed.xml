Detectives soon uncovered evidence pointing to someone shockingly close to her life, her friend Daniel Bartelt.

Prosecutors described a pattern of unexplained collapses, concerning medical notes and altered records that pointed to deliberate actions. Letby has maintained her innocence and is appealing her convictions, while independent reviews continue examining hospital procedures and oversight. The case has become one of the most closely scrutinized medical crime investigations in recent British history.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/1249233650381242.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">692291350606213int</guid><title>Levi King Went on a Rampage and Destroyed Families Just To Feel Something</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/692291350606213/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>In 2005, Levi King crossed through Missouri and Texas on a violent spree that left multiple victims dead within a matter of hours. Investigators later revealed King had stolen weapons, broken into homes and attacked complete strangers with no personal motive, describing his actions as driven by impulse and emotional detachment. He was later captured in El Paso, confessed to the killings and received multiple life sentences.

Some details matched real disappearances, while others shifted each time he retold them. Hall was ultimately convicted in 1995 for the abduction of Jessica Roach, yet many believe he may have far more victims than confirmed. To this day, the line between what Hall actually did and what he fabricated remains one of the most debated mysteries in modern true crime.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/1362400595333795.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">3129016023936066int</guid><title>My Friend Plotted To Take My Unborn Baby!</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/3129016023936066/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 16:05:00 GMT</pubDate><description>In 2011, pregnant teen Angelique Robledo invited another “pregnant” teen, Kassandra Toruga, into her home, unaware Toruga was faking her pregnancy.

Claims of self-defense under Florida’s Stand-Your-Ground law failed to convince a jury, who found Lorincz guilty of manslaughter and sentenced her to 25 years. The crime is now the focus of the Netflix documentary The Perfect Neighbor, which uses body-cam footage to examine the breakdown of community, race and self-defense.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/1947755219115282.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1625682778598459int</guid><title>He Ended The Life Of His Pregnant Girlfriend</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1625682778598459/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 23:01:00 GMT</pubDate><description>He Ended The Life Of His Pregnant Girlfriend</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/thumb_1625682778598459.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1526166095472792int</guid><title>BIZARRE Relationship Between Mother &amp; Son</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1526166095472792/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>Between 1978 and 1981, Spokane, Washington was terrorized by a man authorities later identified as Frederick “Kevin” Coe. For years, dozens of women were attacked in the same upscale neighborhood, leaving the city on edge until a series of identifications finally led investigators to Coe. The case only grew stranger as details emerged about his background, his powerful family, and his mother’s extreme attempts to defend him—even plotting retaliation against officials. Multiple trials, overturned convictions, and a landmark legal battle eventually resulted in Coe being confined as a sexually violent predator, where he remains today.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/1526166095472792.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">4250513958602761int</guid><title>The Terrifying Story Of Peter Keller</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/4250513958602761/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><description>In 2012, investigators in Washington State searched for Peter Keller after discovering that his wife and daughter had been found deceased inside the family home.

Before her arrest in 1991, she spent years without stable housing, support, or access to meaningful help. Prosecutors, investigators, and people around her later acknowledged that her circumstances and trauma shaped nearly every part of her life. Her case raises ongoing questions about how vulnerable individuals move through systems that are not equipped to protect them, and how those gaps can lead to tragic outcomes for everyone involved.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/742946614724408.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1292002872609378int</guid><title>Unraveling the Evil Plot of Jennifer Faith</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1292002872609378/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><description>Jennifer Lynne Faith admitted to orchestrating the 2020 killing of her husband, Jamie Faith, by persuading her former high-school boyfriend to carry out the shooting and concealing a $600 k life-insurance claim and a GoFundMe fraud.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/1292002872609378.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">2928679820853904int</guid><title>"Do You Want Mom to Live?"
