According to a probable cause affidavit, Joshua Brown told investigators that an argument escalated inside the couple’s home. He admitted to physically assaulting Shawntae Brown and later stated that he “went too far.” Emergency responders were called to the scene, where Shawntae was pronounced deceased.  Police took Joshua Brown into custody and charged him in connection with his wife’s death. Investigators say the case remains active as authorities continue reviewing evidence and statements.  Court records indicate Brown is being held while legal proceedings move forward. Officials have not released additional details at this time.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/thumb_1540963497104002.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1255681973284618au</guid><title>His EVIL Christmas Plans For His Family</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1255681973284618/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>In December 1987, authorities in Arkansas uncovered a severe family tragedy involving Ronald Gene Simmons, a middle aged man living in the small town of Dover. What initially appeared to be a private household matter quickly expanded into a major criminal investigation spanning multiple locations in Pope County.  Investigators determined that Simmons had been living an increasingly isolated life with his family, largely disconnected from schools, neighbors, and community services. Court records later revealed long standing issues inside the home that had gone unnoticed for years, raising questions about how warning signs can be missed in closed family environments.  After leaving his residence, Simmons traveled to Russellville, where additional incidents occurred at a former workplace, prompting a large scale law enforcement response. He was taken into custody the same day without resistance.  The case resulted in multiple convictions and remains one of the most studied examples of how prolonged isolation, lack of oversight, and unreported domestic abuse can escalate into extreme outcomes. Today, it is referenced in academic, legal, and prevention focused discussions about family safety and early intervention.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/1255681973284618.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1825873661400127au</guid><title>Genius Turned Psychopath, Peter Madsen!</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1825873661400127/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>Peter Madsen was a Danish engineer and entrepreneur once known for his work on homemade submarines and rockets. He gained public attention for ambitious projects that drew support from volunteers and curiosity from international media. That image changed in August 2017 after journalist Kim Wall boarded his privately built submarine for an interview.  Wall never returned from the trip, and authorities launched a large scale search in Danish waters. Investigators later confirmed that she had died during the voyage. Madsen initially gave conflicting explanations before evidence presented in court contradicted his accounts.  In 2018, a Danish court convicted Madsen of murder and related charges after weeks of testimony and forensic analysis. Prosecutors established that the crime occurred inside the submarine and rejected claims that the death was accidental. He was sentenced to life in prison, the harshest penalty under Danish law.  The case shocked Denmark and the global science community, raising questions about how someone celebrated for technical skill was able to conceal violent behavior. It also prompted broader discussion about trust power dynamics and accountability within unconventional innovation circles.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/1825873661400127.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1623956098573035au</guid><title>The Horrifying Secrets of Robert Pickton's Pig Farm</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1623956098573035/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>Robert Pickton was a Canadian pig farmer whose property in Port Coquitlam British Columbia became the focus of a major police investigation in the early 2000s. Authorities began examining the farm after years of reports involving missing women many of whom were last seen in the Vancouver area.  In 2002 police executed a search warrant on Pickton’s property following allegations unrelated to homicide. During that search investigators uncovered evidence that led them to believe the farm was connected to multiple disappearances. The findings prompted one of the largest and most complex investigations in Canadian history.  Pickton was later charged and convicted in connection with the deaths of several women based on forensic evidence witness testimony and his own statements introduced at trial. Prosecutors argued that the crimes occurred over an extended period while Pickton lived a largely unnoticed life.  The case raised serious questions about how vulnerable people are protected and how long patterns of violence can go undetected. Pickton was sentenced to life in prison and the investigation led to public inquiries into police response and systemic failures surrounding missing persons cases in Canada.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/1623956098573035.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">869433488868180au</guid><title>John Lennon's Life Cut Short By CRAZED Fan</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/869433488868180/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>On the night of December 8, 1980, John Lennon returned home to the Dakota building in Manhattan after a recording session with Yoko Ono. As the couple approached their entrance, a man who had been waiting outside stepped forward and opened fire. Lennon was rushed to Roosevelt Hospital, but doctors were unable to save him. His death was confirmed within minutes of arrival.  The attacker was Mark David Chapman, a fan who had traveled from Hawaii to confront Lennon. Throughout the day, he lingered outside the Dakota, even having Lennon sign an album hours before the shooting. Chapman remained at the scene afterward, reading a book until police arrested him without resistance. He later admitted to planning the act in advance, and he was ultimately convicted and sentenced to 20 years to life.  The news of Lennon’s death spread instantly, prompting an outpouring of grief around the world. Fans gathered outside hospitals, radio stations played Beatles and solo songs nonstop, and global memorials formed in the days that followed. Lennon had just reentered the music scene with a new album, leaving many to wonder what artistic chapters had been cut short.  More than four decades later, the case remains one of the most talked-about tragedies in music history. It changed how the public viewed celebrity safety, and it highlighted the dangers of obsessive behavior toward public figures. Lennon’s legacy continues through his music, his activism, and the cultural impact he left behind.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/2722876767739321/869433488868180.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1545276533183663au</guid><title>What Really Happened in Anna Kepner’s Stateroom on that Cruise Ship?</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1545276533183663/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>18-year-old Anna Kepner was found unresponsive inside a stateroom aboard the Carnival Horizon during a family cruise.
