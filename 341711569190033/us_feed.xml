Just days before, her ex-boyfriend Bricen Rivers had been released on bail in Nashville, despite a violent domestic assault and kidnapping in December 2023. Numerous alleged system failures—including GPS monitoring malfunctions, bond condition breaches, and lack of official alerts—allowed Rivers to cross state lines. He’s now charged with capital murder, grand larceny, and evidence tampering, and has pleaded not guilty. The case has prompted Lauren’s father to push for “Lauren’s Law,” legislation to deny bail in domestic violence cases to prevent future tragedies.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://scontent-sof1-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/500893667_625408730519667_4986181499083509348_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p160x160_tt6&amp;_nc_cat=111&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=200999&amp;_nc_ohc=hzoPvJu4DrQQ7kNvwFXcVjp&amp;_nc_oc=AdlQpj2XV8FuNCtvZbu75kKO4Hpnbmvj_Dh-HuQG5N5yIJhYiVtVbEnyvqQbOG42CerDcF4_OKUnNCtT9dr32KPZ&amp;_nc_zt=23&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-sof1-2.xx&amp;edm=APRAPSkEAAAA&amp;_nc_gid=hxEyO3bfnw_qVAl1j_ayiw&amp;oh=00_AfUW2MmeYzdZw-qLM5qeKoOHsUP3gZV7Kx0BONN298FNjg&amp;oe=68A51312" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1194358769375496us</guid><title>She Adopted Him &amp; He Took Her Life</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/1194358769375496/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 14:01:09 GMT</pubDate><description>A devastating case in which Carlos Hallowell turned on his adoptive mother, highlighting the shocking reality behind the crime.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/1194358769375496.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1097938171685231us</guid><title>His Web of Lies Fell Apart Fast | Owen Pellow *Bodycam*</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/1097938171685231/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 14:01:13 GMT</pubDate><description>Bodycam footage captures the rapid breakdown of Owen Pellow’s false story as the truth comes to light.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/1097938171685231.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1123487606298626us</guid><title>Chilling as a Thriller, Disturbingly Real: The Chad Doerman Case</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/1123487606298626/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 20:00:07 GMT</pubDate><description>Explore the Chad Doerman case, a story that reads like a thriller yet is rooted in real events, revealing unsettling details.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/1123487606298626.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">2823914181140463us</guid><title>Innocent United Fans, Just 10 Years Old, Never Made It Out</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/2823914181140463/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 20:00:09 GMT</pubDate><description>The Soham murders refer to the tragic 2002 killings of 10-year-old friends Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in Soham, Cambridgeshire, England. The girls vanished on August 4 after leaving a family barbecue, sparking a massive nationwide search. Their bodies were discovered 13 days later in a remote area. Ian Huntley, a school caretaker, was convicted of their murders and sentenced to life in prison, while his girlfriend, Maxine Carr, was jailed for perverting the course of justice. The case shocked the UK, leading to widespread grief and significant changes in child protection policies, including improved background checks for those working with children. It remains one of Britain’s most infamous and heartbreaking crimes.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/2823914181140463.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1502316984279827us</guid><title>"She's Been in the Freezer for Two Days"</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/1502316984279827/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 14:08:13 GMT</pubDate><description>"She's Been in the Freezer for Two Days"</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/1502316984279827.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1073816168249954us</guid><title>She Fed Her In-Laws a Poisonous Lunch</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/1073816168249954/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 20:42:13 GMT</pubDate><description>She Fed Her In-Laws a Poisonous Lunch</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/1073816168249954.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1293986042228293us</guid><title>She Went for a Run &amp; Never Made It Back</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/1293986042228293/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 14:06:15 GMT</pubDate><description>She Went for a Run &amp; Never Made It Back</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/1293986042228293.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1774132310160540us</guid><title>He Lured Her in with EMPTY Promises!��</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/1774132310160540/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 20:00:59 GMT</pubDate><description>He Lured Her in with EMPTY Promises!��</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/1774132310160540.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">979756180865137us</guid><title>He Didn't Realise It Was All Recorded on CCTV</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/979756180865137/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 14:00:50 GMT</pubDate><description>In August 2020, 22-year-old Lesley Palacio vanished after a night out in Las Vegas.
