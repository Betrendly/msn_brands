The girls vanished on August 4 after leaving a family barbecue, sparking a massive nationwide search. Their bodies were discovered 13 days later in a remote area. Ian Huntley, a school caretaker, was convicted of their murders and sentenced to life in prison, while his girlfriend, Maxine Carr, was jailed for perverting the course of justice. The case shocked the UK, leading to widespread grief and significant changes in child protection policies, including improved background checks for those working with children. It remains one of Britain’s most infamous and heartbreaking crimes.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/2823914181140463.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1502316984279827</guid><title>"She's Been in the Freezer for Two Days"</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/1502316984279827/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 14:08:13 GMT</pubDate><description>"She's Been in the Freezer for Two Days"</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/1502316984279827.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1073816168249954</guid><title>She Fed Her In-Laws a Poisonous Lunch</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/1073816168249954/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 20:42:13 GMT</pubDate><description>She Fed Her In-Laws a Poisonous Lunch</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/1073816168249954.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1293986042228293</guid><title>She Went for a Run &amp; Never Made It Back</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/1293986042228293/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 14:06:15 GMT</pubDate><description>She Went for a Run &amp; Never Made It Back</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/1293986042228293.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1774132310160540</guid><title>He Lured Her in with EMPTY Promises!��</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/1774132310160540/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 20:00:59 GMT</pubDate><description>He Lured Her in with EMPTY Promises!��</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/1774132310160540.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">979756180865137</guid><title>He Didn't Realise It Was All Recorded on CCTV</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/979756180865137/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 14:00:50 GMT</pubDate><description>In August 2020, 22-year-old Lesley Palacio vanished after a night out in Las Vegas.
