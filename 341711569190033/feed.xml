Days later, her dismembered remains were found in their home and a nearby park. Stephen confessed to strangling her and attempting to hide the crime, later receiving a 50–80 year sentence. The case exposed the chilling reality of domestic violence behind a seemingly perfect suburban life.

McCandless, whose story changed multiple times, was sentenced in 2020 to life in prison with parole eligibility after 50 years.
