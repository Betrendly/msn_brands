When found unresponsive in his cot, doctors discovered he had suffered a snapped neck and more than 40 fractures, including broken ribs, arms, legs, and skull injuries. Experts compared the trauma to the aftermath of a high-impact car crash. After a six-year investigation, Ollie’s father, Michael Davis, was convicted in March 2024 of murder and grievous bodily harm. He was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 22 years. His mother, Kayleigh Driver, was acquitted of murder but found guilty of causing or allowing the death and serious injury of a child, receiving a seven-year sentence. A safeguarding review later criticized social services for missed opportunities and poor information sharing, though it concluded these failures did not directly cause Ollie’s death. The case prompted significant reforms in child protection procedures.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/653347223776883.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1722391261748295sg</guid><title>It Was a Call from God: The Horror of the Turpin Family</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/1722391261748295/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 21:01:29 GMT</pubDate><description>The Turpin family case horrified the nation in 2018, when 13 children were rescued from their parents’ home in Perris, California.

She was last seen riding her scooter near her family’s apartment complex before disappearing, sparking a community-wide search. The next day, her body was discovered in a recycling bin within the complex. Adrian Jerry Gonzalez, a 15-year-old neighbor, was arrested and charged with her kidnapping, sexual assault, and murder. The case shocked the local community due to Gonzalez’s age and the brutality of the crime. It raised difficult questions about juvenile offenders, community safety, and how such violence could occur in what seemed like a safe, close-knit neighborhood.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/1694156894619728.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">2181382882361520sg</guid><title>Behind the scenes</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/2181382882361520/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>Behind the scenes</description><media:thumbnail url="https://scontent-sof1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/532373828_777521591385575_4556530529081719921_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p160x160_tt6&amp;_nc_cat=108&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=200999&amp;_nc_ohc=3PQB007yFVUQ7kNvwHp2UxS&amp;_nc_oc=Adn2dVxJWe7HaL7mJocZxSOQROxFHUnE-ZP8yvKBC-TWuZupPZhm0mEzWaIrfqrhJbfngnPNN9fhKiETVKFU6E6y&amp;_nc_zt=23&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-sof1-1.xx&amp;edm=APRAPSkEAAAA&amp;_nc_gid=98q-x5-fvFY2ownAS7T5tg&amp;oh=00_AfUBQmjt_97lEHZo78zOTHV4jVSS2XPYjYq3i0rlxNm5DQ&amp;oe=68A3B413" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1314052210429863sg</guid><title>He Tried to Break into His Ex's House!</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/1314052210429863/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 20:01:24 GMT</pubDate><description>22-year-old James Rayl died on July 31, 2022, after attempting to force his way into his ex-girlfriend’s home in Sidney, Ohio. A surveillance video shows him repeatedly banging on the door and then breaking in despite warnings that the homeowner was armed; he was shot three times by her father and collapsed in the driveway. Under Ohio’s “Stand Your Ground” and “Castle Doctrine” laws, a grand jury declined to indict the father—viewing the use of lethal force as justified to protect family and property. The case sparked debate over self-defense rights and boundaries of legal force in domestic contexts.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/1314052210429863.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1256333115640046sg</guid><title>She Knew He Would TAKE Her Life</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/1256333115640046/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:00:46 GMT</pubDate><description>22-year-old nursing student Lauren Johansen was tragically found beaten to death and wrapped in a sheet inside her car near Wolf River Cemetery in Mississippi on July 3, 2024. Just days before, her ex-boyfriend Bricen Rivers had been released on bail in Nashville, despite a violent domestic assault and kidnapping in December 2023. Numerous alleged system failures—including GPS monitoring malfunctions, bond condition breaches, and lack of official alerts—allowed Rivers to cross state lines. He’s now charged with capital murder, grand larceny, and evidence tampering, and has pleaded not guilty. The case has prompted Lauren’s father to push for “Lauren’s Law,” legislation to deny bail in domestic violence cases to prevent future tragedies.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://scontent-sof1-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/500893667_625408730519667_4986181499083509348_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_p160x160_tt6&amp;_nc_cat=111&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=200999&amp;_nc_ohc=hzoPvJu4DrQQ7kNvwFXcVjp&amp;_nc_oc=AdlQpj2XV8FuNCtvZbu75kKO4Hpnbmvj_Dh-HuQG5N5yIJhYiVtVbEnyvqQbOG42CerDcF4_OKUnNCtT9dr32KPZ&amp;_nc_zt=23&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-sof1-2.xx&amp;edm=APRAPSkEAAAA&amp;_nc_gid=hxEyO3bfnw_qVAl1j_ayiw&amp;oh=00_AfUW2MmeYzdZw-qLM5qeKoOHsUP3gZV7Kx0BONN298FNjg&amp;oe=68A51312" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1194358769375496sg</guid><title>She Adopted Him &amp; He Took Her Life</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/1194358769375496/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 14:01:09 GMT</pubDate><description>A devastating case in which Carlos Hallowell turned on his adoptive mother, highlighting the shocking reality behind the crime.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/1194358769375496.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1097938171685231sg</guid><title>His Web of Lies Fell Apart Fast | Owen Pellow *Bodycam*</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/1097938171685231/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 14:01:13 GMT</pubDate><description>Bodycam footage captures the rapid breakdown of Owen Pellow’s false story as the truth comes to light.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/1097938171685231.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1123487606298626sg</guid><title>Chilling as a Thriller, Disturbingly Real: The Chad Doerman Case</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/emmakennytv/videos/1123487606298626/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 20:00:07 GMT</pubDate><description>Explore the Chad Doerman case, a story that reads like a thriller yet is rooted in real events, revealing unsettling details.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/1123487606298626.jpg" /></item></channel></rss>
