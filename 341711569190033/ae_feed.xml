Surveillance footage showed her leaving a casino with Erick Rangel-Ibarra, a family acquaintance. Days later, her body was found near Valley of Fire State Park, showing signs of blunt force trauma. Rangel-Ibarra fled to Mexico, sparking a months-long manhunt, while his father was convicted for helping hide the crime. Erick was eventually captured and extradited, later sentenced to life in prison. Lesly’s death ignited outrage and calls for justice, highlighting how trust can turn tragically deadly. How can young women stay safe when danger often comes from those they know?</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/thumb_2856705804529363.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1145875080853395ae</guid><title>She Sold Her Skin &amp; Eyes for Black Magic!</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1145875080853395/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><description>A local pastor testified that he had once heard Smith talk of selling her children for 20,000 rand ($1,100; £850) each, but would have been willing to accept a lower figure of $275...

The shocking attack came just weeks before his wedding and followed years of lies about his job, finances and lifestyle. When someone builds an entire life around deception and then resorts to violence to hide it, what do you think cracked first: the lies themselves, the fear of being exposed—or something deeper?
