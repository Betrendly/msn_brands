Her mother, Sharon Goldie, ignored her daughter’s pleas for help and failed to seek medical care as Robyn’s condition worsened. In 2020, Sharon admitted to culpable homicide and child neglect, receiving a prison sentence of six years. The case exposed heartbreaking failures in both parenting and social care systems. How many silent cries for help go unheard until it’s too late?</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/thumb_1173908284702608.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">795233416654725nz</guid><title>He Took LYING to the Next Level</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/795233416654725/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 20:01:00 GMT</pubDate><description>"I am not great with blood."

Days later, her dismembered remains were found in their home and a nearby park. Stephen confessed to strangling her and attempting to hide the crime, later receiving a 50–80 year sentence. The case exposed the chilling reality of domestic violence behind a seemingly perfect suburban life.

McCandless, whose story changed multiple times, was sentenced in 2020 to life in prison with parole eligibility after 50 years. Since then, she has repeatedly appealed her conviction, most recently in 2025, arguing issues with evidence and the voluntariness of her statements, but so far all attempts have been denied...</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/857204959982146.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1847622452507107nz</guid><title>When a Mother Does the Unthinkable to Her Child</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1847622452507107/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 14:11:00 GMT</pubDate><description>In 2022, 15-year-old Timothy Ferguson was found deceased in his Michigan home after months of abuse and starvation at the hands of his mother, Shanda Vander Ark, and complicity from his older brother, Paul.
