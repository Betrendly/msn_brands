His crimes went unsolved for years before a confession revealed their scope. He is serving multiple life sentences.

Instead, he faced danger from someone who should have been nurturing him, not hurting him. Letecia’s actions weren’t just violent; they were calculated, layered with deception, and followed by a shocking attempt to rewrite the narrative. This case reminds us how critical it is to pay attention to small signs, to listen to children, and to acknowledge that sometimes the greatest danger comes from behind closed doors, not outside them. When you look at this case, what unsettles you the most — the betrayal of a parental role, the manipulation that followed, or the heartbreaking loss of a child who trusted the very person who harmed him?</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/341711569190033/2083676595713261.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1173909954933730nz</guid><title>Pursued Without Escape In A Violent Walsall Attack</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1173909954933730/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 20:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>Bailey Atkinson, 21, was chased through Walsall’s market area and stabbed with machetes and so-called zombie knives in a revenge attack involving stolen cars.
