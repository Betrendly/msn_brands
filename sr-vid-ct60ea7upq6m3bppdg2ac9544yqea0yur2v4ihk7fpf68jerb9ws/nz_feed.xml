In this deep dive, I explore how investigators tied that dessert to a powerful tranquilizer, uncovered an international warrant, and followed the case all the way to a 2023 jury verdict. Along the way, I focus on how Olga rebuilt her life and what this story says about trust, instinct, and staying aware of the people around us.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/sr-vid-ct60ea7upq6m3bppdg2ac9544yqea0yur2v4ihk7fpf68jerb9ws/5161cad77bbd4182.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">ee4a277226b14838nz</guid><title>Did a 15 year old Ended His Mother &amp; Brother?</title><link>https://facebook.com/reel/667040722747578/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>In March 2025, a heartbreaking discovery was made inside a Saratoga Springs home - a mother and young boy found lifeless under mysterious circumstances.
