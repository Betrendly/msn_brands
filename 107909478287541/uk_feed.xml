Instead of going to police, prosecutors say the mother began searching for a way to make her husband suffer, eventually attempting to hire a hitman and later trying to poison him herself in a plan designed to kill him slowly. What followed was a tangled investigation involving hidden abuse allegations, disturbing family dynamics, and a murder plot that shocked investigators once it came to light. The Solomon family case raises chilling questions about justice, revenge, and what happens when trauma turns into something far more dangerous.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/107909478287541/1231661238880414.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">865457116462800uk</guid><title>The Yoo Ah-In Scandal In Korea!

Maxwell denies recruiting underage girls, stating she would find masseuses at "legitimate spas" and ask them to do "home visits" for Epstein, but "never ever checked their age".

By morning, she reported being assaulted by a group of his teammates who were invited into the room without her knowledge. Years later, five players were charged and brought to trial, but all were acquitted. The verdict sparked outrage across North America and prompted other women to come forward with similar allegations involving junior hockey players. Central to the case was a recorded consent video that prosecutors argued was used to manipulate and silence victims rather than protect them. This video examines the testimony, the trial outcome, the culture surrounding junior hockey, and why so many believe the story does not end with this single case.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/107909478287541/1228415802488078.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">787528413746316uk</guid><title>She Tried To Turn 2 Boyfriends Into “Human Kimchi”</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/787528413746316/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>When detectives opened what appeared to be ordinary kimchi containers, they realized they were standing at the beginning of a horrifying investigation. Inside were the remains of two men who had been romantically involved with the same woman. As police raced to understand what happened, they uncovered a disturbing pattern of manipulation, control, and escalating violence. This video breaks down how a seemingly ordinary relationship spiraled into one of South Korea’s most shocking murder cases and why investigators feared she was only just getting started.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/107909478287541/787528413746316.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1126220859397085uk</guid><title>Aziza Kibibi: The Survivor Who Exposed a Lifetime of Abuse Hidden in Plain Sight</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1126220859397085/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>Aziza Kibibi grew up isolated from the outside world, trapped in a home where secrecy and control shaped every part of her life. From childhood, she endured ongoing abuse at the hands of her father, resulting in multiple pregnancies before she reached adulthood. Forced to give birth without medical care and raise children under constant surveillance, Aziza’s world was defined by silence, manipulation, and betrayal from the very people meant to protect her. Yet despite years of captivity and trauma, she found a way to escape, seek justice, and reclaim her identity. Her story is not only a harrowing account of survival but a testament to resilience and the fight to break generational cycles of abuse.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/107909478287541/1126220859397085.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">4389997201268146uk</guid><title>“Get Used To It”: Epstein’s Chilling Response After Survivor Reports Violent Assault</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/4389997201268146/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>When a teenage Virginia Giuffre confided in Jeffrey Epstein about a horrifyingly violent assault she endured at the hands of one of the powerful men she was being trafficked to, she expected outrage, protection, or at the very least sympathy. Instead, Epstein allegedly looked at her and coldly said, “Get used to it.”  According to Giuffre’s memoir and deposition, this moment became a turning point that revealed the true scale of the abuse machine she was trapped inside. Epstein was not merely exploiting young girls for his own gratification, she claims, but funneling them to elite figures across politics, academia, science, and royalty. The message was clear: pain, fear, and violence were not exceptions in this network, they were standard operating procedure.  Giuffre says she realized then that escape would come at massive personal risk and silence could mean survival. Yet years later, she chose to speak. Her testimony has helped unravel one of the darkest criminal webs of the modern era and continues to raise urgent questions about who knew what, and how many powerful individuals still remain unexposed.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/107909478287541/4389997201268146.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">25523067617383070uk</guid><title>The Controversial Events That Brought Prince Andrew into Epstein’s Criminal Web</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/25523067617383070/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 07:15:00 GMT</pubDate><description>For years, whispers surrounded the friendship between Prince Andrew and convicted trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, but the full picture of how the British royal became entangled in one of the most explosive criminal scandals of the century has only grown darker. Their connection spans luxury estates, private jets, exclusive parties, closed-door meetings, and a growing list of disturbing allegations made by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who says she was trafficked to the prince as a teenager. Despite public denials, shifting statements, and photos that refuse to fade away, questions remain about what Andrew knew, how far his involvement went, and why his ties to Epstein continued even after Epstein’s first conviction. As legal pressure mounted and public outrage intensified, Andrew stepped back from royal duties, but the scrutiny never stopped. With more hidden files expected to surface, the world is still waiting to learn whether his chapter in the Epstein story is a tale of ignorance, complicity, or something far more unsettling.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/107909478287541/25523067617383070.jpg" /></item></channel></rss>
