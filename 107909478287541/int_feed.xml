As she waited near the elevator in her building, the man suddenly approached from behind and delivered a forceful kick to her head. The impact caused her to collapse, after which the assailant continued the attack before fleeing the scene.CCTV footage captured the initial moments of the incident, showing the man trailing the victim for approximately 10 minutes prior to the confrontation. Authorities quickly identified and arrested the suspect, who had no prior connection to the woman. The case, widely known as the Busan roundhouse kick incident, highlighted concerns over random stranger assaults.The perpetrator was charged with attempted murder with intent related to sexual assault, based on evidence including DNA findings. Courts reviewed the case thoroughly, with an appellate ruling increasing the sentence to 20 years in prison in 2023. The Supreme Court upheld this decision later that year, emphasizing the premeditated nature of the attack.The victim has spoken publicly about her recovery process and the broader implications for public safety. No additional incidents involving the assailant have been reported since his conviction. The case prompted discussions on strengthening protections against such unprovoked acts.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/107909478287541/866036729119943.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1397210885094289int</guid><title>She Killed Her Own Child During a Psychotic Break | The Terrifying Case of Dena Schlosser</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1397210885094289/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>Dena Schlosser’s case is one of the most disturbing examples of untreated mental illness colliding with tragedy.
