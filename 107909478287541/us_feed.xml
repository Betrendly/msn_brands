Their connection spans luxury estates, private jets, exclusive parties, closed-door meetings, and a growing list of disturbing allegations made by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who says she was trafficked to the prince as a teenager. Despite public denials, shifting statements, and photos that refuse to fade away, questions remain about what Andrew knew, how far his involvement went, and why his ties to Epstein continued even after Epstein’s first conviction. As legal pressure mounted and public outrage intensified, Andrew stepped back from royal duties, but the scrutiny never stopped. With more hidden files expected to surface, the world is still waiting to learn whether his chapter in the Epstein story is a tale of ignorance, complicity, or something far more unsettling.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/107909478287541/25523067617383070.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">843264625087725us</guid><title>India’s Youngest Murderer: How an 8-Year-Old Got Away With Multiple Killings</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/843264625087725/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><description>At just eight years old, Amarjeet Sada committed crimes so disturbing that even adults struggle to comprehend them.

As she waited near the elevator in her building, the man suddenly approached from behind and delivered a forceful kick to her head. The impact caused her to collapse, after which the assailant continued the attack before fleeing the scene.CCTV footage captured the initial moments of the incident, showing the man trailing the victim for approximately 10 minutes prior to the confrontation. Authorities quickly identified and arrested the suspect, who had no prior connection to the woman. The case, widely known as the Busan roundhouse kick incident, highlighted concerns over random stranger assaults.The perpetrator was charged with attempted murder with intent related to sexual assault, based on evidence including DNA findings. Courts reviewed the case thoroughly, with an appellate ruling increasing the sentence to 20 years in prison in 2023. The Supreme Court upheld this decision later that year, emphasizing the premeditated nature of the attack.The victim has spoken publicly about her recovery process and the broader implications for public safety. No additional incidents involving the assailant have been reported since his conviction. The case prompted discussions on strengthening protections against such unprovoked acts.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/107909478287541/866036729119943.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1397210885094289us</guid><title>She Killed Her Own Child During a Psychotic Break | The Terrifying Case of Dena Schlosser</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1397210885094289/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>Dena Schlosser’s case is one of the most disturbing examples of untreated mental illness colliding with tragedy.

But behind that image was a pattern of violence toward women that would culminate in the brutal killing of 18-year-old Jennifer Levin in Central Park. The case exposed how wealth, status, and media bias shaped public perception, turning a victim into a target while her killer was framed as misunderstood. In this video, we break down Chambers’ behavior, the trial that divided the nation, and why his crimes against young women still spark outrage decades later.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/107909478287541/1144968867416808.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1166865242326576us</guid><title>Five Rising Hockey Stars Accused of a Brutal Group Assault</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1166865242326576/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>As five elite junior hockey players stood on the brink of NHL careers, a young woman’s report of a violent sexual assault threatened to derail everything.
