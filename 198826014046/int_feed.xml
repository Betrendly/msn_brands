For the past 28 years the AVC has brought together dozens of notable veterans of the last 80 years of history for our Annual Veterans Conference, where they share their lessons and experiences with an audience of several hundred students from each of the military service academies &amp; ROTC programs from across the country. Participants range from surviving heroes of WWII to recipients of the Medal of Honor to young Special Operations veterans of todayâ€™s military. The weekend of programming concludes with American Valor: A Salute to Our Heroes, a black-tie gala filmed as a Veterans Day television special, airing on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox stations across the country, and to all military personnel around the world on American Forces Network. We look forward to our 28th Annual Conference &amp; Gala this coming November!</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/198826014046/1485046902837288.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">735157396358341int</guid><title>Filming The First Complete Battle at Tarawa</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/735157396358341/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 17:01:00 GMT</pubDate><description>What was it like to film the reality of combat?
