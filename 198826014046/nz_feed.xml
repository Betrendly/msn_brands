While commanding a UH-1H ambulance helicopter, Brady flew dangerous rescue missions deep in enemy-held territory which was heavily defended and often blanketed by dense fog.

On January 6, 1968, Brady was off duty but volunteered to rescue wounded men from four sites in enemy territory. Throughout that day, Brady utilized three helicopters to evacuate a total of 51 seriously wounded men. For these actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/198826014046/1132160189010475.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1983019065828281nz</guid><title>How We Learned to Kill the Enemy in Fallujah</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/americanveteranscenter/videos/1983019065828281/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 17:01:00 GMT</pubDate><description>What does it take to survive urban combat?

George Hardy, who was the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen to fly combat missions, passed away on September 25, 2025 at the age of 100.

The Tuskegee Airmen were a group of primarily African-American military pilots and airmen who fought in World War II. Before the Tuskegee Airmen, no African American had ever been a United States military pilot.

Hardy deployed in early 1945 to Italy joining the African American 99th Fighter Squadron, 332nd Fighter Group. He flew 21 combat missions over Germany and occupied Europe piloting P-51 Mustang aircraft, often escorting heavy bombers. Following World War II, Hardy flew 45 combat missions during the Korean War as the pilot of a bomber and 70 missions piloting an AC-119K gunship during the Vietnam War.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/198826014046/1284579316329122.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">2218335911925427nz</guid><title>WWII Veteran Manny Carvalho explains the motivation in fighting behind someone like General George Patton.</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/2218335911925427/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2025 21:39:00 GMT</pubDate><description>WWII Veteran Manny Carvalho explains the motivation in fighting behind someone like General George Patton.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/198826014046/2218335911925427.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">836406618810818nz</guid><title>We Could Smell The Camps Before We Saw Them</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/americanveteranscenter/videos/836406618810818/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2025 17:02:00 GMT</pubDate><description>This is the deeply moving story of a soldier who liberated a concentration camp.

For the past 28 years the AVC has brought together dozens of notable veterans of the last 80 years of history for our Annual Veterans Conference, where they share their lessons and experiences with an audience of several hundred students from each of the military service academies &amp; ROTC programs from across the country. Participants range from surviving heroes of WWII to recipients of the Medal of Honor to young Special Operations veterans of today’s military. The weekend of programming concludes with American Valor: A Salute to Our Heroes, a black-tie gala filmed as a Veterans Day television special, airing on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox stations across the country, and to all military personnel around the world on American Forces Network. We look forward to our 28th Annual Conference &amp; Gala this coming November!</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/198826014046/2319556145169447.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">793817126942091nz</guid><title>I Was Knocked Unconscious When Our Chopper Crashed</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/americanveteranscenter/videos/793817126942091/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 15:01:00 GMT</pubDate><description>A veteran recounts a moment that would change his life forever.
