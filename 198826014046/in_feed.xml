For the past 28 years the AVC has brought together dozens of notable veterans of the last 80 years of history for our Annual Veterans Conference, where they share their lessons and experiences with an audience of several hundred students from each of the military service academies &amp; ROTC programs from across the country. Participants range from surviving heroes of WWII to recipients of the Medal of Honor to young Special Operations veterans of today’s military. The weekend of programming concludes with American Valor: A Salute to Our Heroes, a black-tie gala filmed as a Veterans Day television special, airing on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox stations across the country, and to all military personnel around the world on American Forces Network. We look forward to our 28th Annual Conference &amp; Gala this coming November!</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/198826014046/2319556145169447.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">793817126942091in</guid><title>I Was Knocked Unconscious When Our Chopper Crashed</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/americanveteranscenter/videos/793817126942091/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 15:01:00 GMT</pubDate><description>A veteran recounts a moment that would change his life forever.

She spent more than two decades in the military including serving as a squadron commander in the Air Force. She is the last surviving member of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion.

This Battalion was the first and only all-female African American unit deployed overseas during WWII. They were sent to Birmingham, England and then to Rouen, France to sort through the two year backlog of undelivered mail destined for the men on the front.</description><media:thumbnail url="https://storage.googleapis.com/trendly_facebook_videos/198826014046/1600200967611227.jpg" /></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1458739558577183in</guid><title>The day the 101st Airborne escorted the Little Rock Nine.</title><link>https://www.facebook.com/reel/1458739558577183/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 19:15:00 GMT</pubDate><description>During this month back in 1957, nine students known as the iconic ‘Little Rock Nine,’ were integrated into Little Rock Central High School following Brown v.
