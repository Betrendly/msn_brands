It is a curious question that I decided to test out. Since gasoline does absorb moisture form the air there will be a tiny amount of water in regular gasoline. So first I drop a chunk of sodium in regular gasoline to see if  get a reaction. Then I drop some in gasoline mixed with water. Finally I drop some in pure water. Watch to see which gave the strongest explosion!

Then I eat it just to see what it tastes like! I take the DNA out of strawberries, kiwis and even shrimp! This is an amazing experiment that you could do in your own home with  simple ingredients.
